# Monthly-Milk-Production-Estimation

This is a time-series problem . Here , we have To predict milk production per month in units of pounds per cow from Jan-1962 to Dec-1975 .

Responsibilities: 

•	Reading file (like csv) and plot out the time series data

•	Perform train-test split

•	Scale the data

•	Create batch function to feed batches of training data

•	Setting up RNN model

•	Create placeholders for X and y

•	Create RNN layer

•	Create mean squared error loss function, use it to minimize an Adam Optimizer

•	Intialize the global variables and save model for later

•	Run Tensor flow session that trains on the batches created by next_batch function and also add a loss evalution for every 100 training iterations

•	Testing data 

•	Plot out training-testing result for comparison
